# Hi, I'm Whogi! 

Hey, I'm Whogi, a freelance web developer and computer science student currently in college. I have a strong passion for coding and system administration, and I love bringing ideas to life on the web. My primary stack is MEVN (MySQL/MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js), but I've recently started diving into React and Next.js, and I'm really enjoying the journey so far. When I’m not building websites or managing systems, you’ll likely find me gaming or sharpening my skills through freelance work and side projects.
